      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>
        We design and run <strong>high-intent gatherings</strong> — from focused investor breakfasts and side events at major summits to bespoke retreats and salons.
        Our goal is clear: <strong>move conversations forward and unlock real deals</strong>, not just collect business cards.
